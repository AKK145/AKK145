    <h2>Short Biography</h2>
    <p>
        Cooking has always been a special way for me to connect with my family, especially my mom. One evening, while savoring a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup, I was handed the phone to speak with my grandmother. But as I tried to engage, I found myself speechless, unable to communicate in Tamil. This moment brought to the surface my growing detachment from my native language, capable of asking my parents about dinner, but unable to have deeper conversations or express my true thoughts. This disconnection turned into apprehension when I visited my grandparents in Chennai for their 80th birthday. Surrounded by relatives, I was self-conscious of my inability to speak Tamil fluently. In search of familiarity, I found myself in the kitchen, where my grandmother initiated a special moment. Despite the language barrier, she invited me to make sambar with her. Through a combination of broken Tamil, hand-drawn sketches, and unspoken understanding, we connected in a way I hadn't thought possible. The experience showed me that communication is more than words; it is about empathy, openness, and shared moments. That simple act of cooking together revealed a deeper lesson: relationships are built through patience, curiosity, and understanding. Whether in my advocacy work or personal interactions, I have learned to lead with compassion, just as I experienced in the kitchen with my grandmother. Now, as I pursue my ambitions of becoming an advocate, a physician, and a better chef, I carry with me the belief that even the smallest acts of connection can transcend language and bring people closer together.
